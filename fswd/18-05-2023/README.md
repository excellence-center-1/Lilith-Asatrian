## N7 Homework

**The assigned homework:**

1. Create a Rectangle class containing methods for calculating the area and perimeter. The class should have getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the properties of the created object. The properties should be defined as private so that they wouldn't be accessed outside the Rectangle class. Invalid values should be handled as well.

2. Create a class called MathUtils that contains static methods for performing various mathematical operations. The class should include the following static methods:
   - `MathUtils.sum(numbers)`: Accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.
   - `MathUtils.average(numbers)`: Accepts an array of numbers and returns the average (mean) of the numbers.
   - `MathUtils.max(numbers)`: Accepts an array of numbers and returns the maximum number in the array.
   - `MathUtils.min(numbers)`: Accepts an array of numbers and returns the minimum number in the array.
