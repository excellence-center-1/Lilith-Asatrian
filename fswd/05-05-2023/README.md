# N4 homework

**The assigned homework:**
Write a script that prompts the user for their name and their age.
Then, based on their age, generate a personalized message that greets them 
and tells them which stage of life they are in (e.g. "Welcome, John! You are a young adult."). 
Use conditional statements to determine which stage of life the user is in, based on their age.
For example, you could define the stages of life as follows:
 childhood: 0-12 years old
 teenage years: 13-19 years old
 young adult: 20-29 years old
 adult: 30-59 years old
 senior: 60+ years old
